An investigation of abilities of machine learning algorithms to predict the release year of music.

The MATLAB codes here are used to examine the ideas started in the paper:

T. Bertin-Mahieux, D. P. Ellis, B. Whitman, and P. Lamere, “The million song dataset,” in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (IS- MIR 2011), 2011.
